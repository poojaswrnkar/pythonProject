# Quadratic Equation Graph Plotter

This repository contains a Python script that takes three inputs from the user representing the coefficients of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c) and generates a graph of the corresponding quadratic function. The purpose of this script is to visualize the shape of the quadratic curve based on the provided coefficients.

## Features

- Interactive command-line input for quadratic equation coefficients.
- Graphical representation of the quadratic function.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Quadratic Equation Graph Plotter, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library

You can install the Matplotlib library using the following command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
